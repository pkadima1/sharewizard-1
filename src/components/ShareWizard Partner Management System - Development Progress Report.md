ShareWizard Partner Management System - Development Progress Report
🎯 Current Development Status: Translation System Completion
Session Summary
This development session focused on fixing translation key issues in the Partner Management System to ensure production readiness. The main problem was that translation keys were not being properly rendered, showing raw keys like partners.form.emailDetection.userFound instead of actual translated text.
✅ Successfully Completed Tasks
1. Translation Structure Analysis & Fix
Problem Identified:
Code was using translation keys like t('partners.form.emailDetection.userFound') and t('admin.columns.name')
Translation files had incorrect structure with keys under wrong paths
Raw translation keys were displaying in the UI instead of translated text
Solution Implemented:
Restructured both English and French translation files to match expected key paths
Fixed key hierarchy to align with code expectations
Ensured complete translation coverage for all UI elements
2. Translation Files Updated
English Translation File (public/locales/en/partners.json)
Key Changes:
✅ Moved admin.columns.* keys to correct location
✅ Fixed form.emailDetection.* keys structure
✅ Added missing translation keys for email detection features
✅ Ensured all admin interface elements have proper translations
French Translation File (public/locales/fr/partners.json)
Key Changes:
✅ Applied same structural fixes as English file
✅ Provided professional French translations for all keys
✅ Maintained consistent terminology across both languages
✅ Ensured grammatically correct French translations
3. Translation Keys Fixed
Email Detection System:
✅ partners.form.emailDetection.userFound → "User found! Will create partner account for existing user."
✅ partners.form.emailDetection.newUser → "New user will be created with this email."
✅ partners.form.emailDetection.autoDetected → "UID automatically detected from the email address."
✅ partners.form.emailDetection.overrideCreate → "Override: Create New User"
✅ partners.form.emailDetection.overrideDescription → "Override the auto-detection and create a new user instead of using the existing one."
Admin Interface Columns:
✅ admin.columns.name → "Name" / "Nom"
✅ admin.columns.email → "Email" / "Email"
✅ admin.columns.status → "Status" / "Statut"
✅ admin.columns.commission → "Commission Rate" / "Taux de Commission"
✅ admin.columns.referrals → "Referrals" / "Parrainages"
✅ admin.columns.earned → "Total Earned" / "Total Gagné"
✅ admin.columns.joined → "Joined" / "Rejoint"
✅ admin.columns.actions → "Actions" / "Actions"
✅ admin.columns.company → "Company" / "Entreprise"
