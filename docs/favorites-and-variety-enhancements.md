# TopicSuggestionEngine: Favorites & Variety Enhancements

## Overview
Added back the favorites functionality and implemented a system to ensure each regeneration provides 3 different suggestions, improving user experience and topic diversity.

## New Features Added

### 1. **Favorites System** ‚ù§Ô∏è
- **Heart Icon**: Each suggestion card now has a heart button to favorite/unfavorite topics
- **Visual Indicator**: Favorited topics show a filled red heart next to the title
- **Favorites Section**: A dedicated section below suggestions showing all favorited topics
- **Quick Actions**: Users can select or remove favorites directly from the favorites section
- **Clear All**: One-click button to clear all favorites

### 2. **Enhanced Topic Variety** üîÑ
- **Generation Tracking**: System tracks previously generated topics to avoid repetition
- **Expanded Templates**: Increased topic generation templates from 3 to 6+ for each category:
  - Topic-Centric: 6 different patterns (thought-leadership, ultimate-guide, strategy-guide, skills-guide, problem-solving, future-trends)
  - Industry Fusion: 5 different angles (investment, best practices, leadership, compliance, ROI)
  - Fallback: 5 different high-quality alternatives
- **Randomization**: Templates are shuffled to ensure variety in each generation
- **Smart Filtering**: New suggestions exclude previously generated topics when possible

### 3. **Improved Generation Controls** üéØ
- **Two Refresh Options**:
  - **"Refresh"**: Generates new suggestions avoiding recent duplicates
  - **"New Topics"**: Clears generation history and provides completely fresh suggestions
- **Better Feedback**: Updated toast messages to reflect "fresh" topic generation

### 4. **Enhanced Topic Generation Process** üß†
- **Multi-Layer Approach**: Uses all 5 intelligence layers instead of limiting to just 2-3
- **Larger Pool**: Generates more suggestions initially then filters to top 3
- **Smart Deduplication**: Advanced similarity checking to avoid near-duplicates
- **Unique IDs**: Timestamp-based IDs ensure no conflicts between generations

## User Experience Improvements

```

```typescript
const toggleFavorite = useCallback((suggestionId: string) => {
  setFavorites(prev => {
    const newFavorites = new Set(prev);
    if (newFavorites.has(suggestionId)) {
      newFavorites.delete(suggestionId);
      toast.info('Removed from favorites');
    } else {
      newFavorites.add(suggestionId);
      toast.success('Added to favorites');
    }
    return newFavorites;
  });
}, []);
```
