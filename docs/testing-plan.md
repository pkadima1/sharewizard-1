// Testing Plan for Step6ReviewGenerate.tsx

/**
 * This document outlines the testing plan for the integration between 
 * the Step6ReviewGenerate component and the Firebase Cloud Function.
 */

// 1. Manual Testing Scenarios

// Basic Generation Flow
- Verify that all required fields are properly validated before allowing generation
- Confirm progress indicators advance during the generation process
- Verify that the generation stages transition properly (outline → content → complete)
- Confirm error handling when the function fails
- Test the retry functionality after a generation error

// Edge Cases
- Test with minimal required input (just the required fields)
- Test with maximum allowed input (all optional fields filled)
- Test with very large word counts (edge of the allowed range)
- Test with special characters in the input fields
- Test with multiple export formats selected

// Error Handling
- Test network disconnection during generation
- Test Firebase function timeout scenario
- Test when the user has insufficient credits
- Test with invalid input combinations

// 2. Integration Tests

// Function Response Handling
- Verify that the component correctly processes success responses
- Verify that error responses are properly displayed to the user
- Check that progress updates correctly based on generation stages

// Navigation
- Confirm that navigation to the dashboard occurs after successful generation
- Verify that state is properly passed to the dashboard

// 3. Performance Considerations

// Progress Indication
- Ensure progress indicators provide a good user experience
- Adjust the progress update interval based on typical function execution time

// User Feedback
- Verify toast messages appear at appropriate times
- Ensure error messages are clear and actionable

// 4. UI/UX Testing

// Loading States
- Verify that all interactive elements are properly disabled during generation
- Confirm that loading indicators appear and animate correctly

// Error States
- Verify that error alerts are properly styled and contain helpful information
- Confirm that retry buttons work correctly

// Success States
- Verify that success messages appear after generation completes
- Confirm that the navigation to the dashboard works correctly

// 5. Accessibility Testing

// Focus Management
- Ensure focus is properly managed during generation process
- Verify that error messages are properly announced to screen readers

// Color Contrast
- Confirm that all status indicators have sufficient color contrast
- Verify that progress bars are perceivable to users with color vision deficiencies

// 6. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

// Code Documentation
- Ensure the generation process is well-documented
- Add comments explaining error handling and edge cases

// User Documentation
- Update user documentation to explain the generation process
- Document typical generation times and possible errors
