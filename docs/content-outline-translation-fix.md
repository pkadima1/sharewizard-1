# Content Outline Translation Fix

## Summary
Fixed the content outline translation issues where structure sections were showing in English even when the interface was in French.

## Issues Addressed
- Content outline in ContentPreview component was hardcoded in English
- FAQ questions were not properly translated
- Structure format previews were not localized
- Section titles and descriptions needed dynamic translation

## Changes Made

### 1. ContentPreview Component Updates
**File**: `src/components/wizard/smart/ContentPreview.tsx`

#### Fixed Structure Formats:
- **FAQ/Q&A Format**: Translated questions and section descriptions
- **Listicle Format**: Translated list items and overview text  
- **How-To Step-by-Step**: Translated step descriptions and process text
- **Comparison/vs**: Translated comparison sections and analysis text
- **Review/Analysis**: Translated review sections (pros, cons, verdict)
- **Case Study**: Translated all case study sections (background, challenge, solution, results)
- **Default Article**: Translated generic article sections

#### Key Improvements:
- Dynamic language detection for FAQ questions (English/French)
- Proper use of translation keys from `longform.json`
- Consistent translation pattern across all structure formats
- Maintained functionality while adding translation support

### 2. Translation Structure
All translations use existing keys from:
- `public/locales/fr/longform.json` 
- `public/locales/en/longform.json`

#### Key Translation Categories Used:
- `step4.structure.sections.*` - Section names
- `step4.structure.descriptions.*` - Section descriptions  
- `step4.structure.options.*` - Structure format names

### 3. Language-Aware Content Generation
- FAQ questions now dynamically generate in appropriate language
- Content titles adapt to selected language
- Section descriptions use proper translations
- Maintains context and meaning across languages

## Testing Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No lint errors in modified files
- ✅ All translation keys exist in both EN/FR files
- ✅ Development server runs without issues

## Usage
The content outline will now properly display in the selected language when users:
1. Change language preference to French
2. Select any structure format (FAQ, How-To, Comparison, etc.)
3. View the content preview panel

## Files Modified
- `src/components/wizard/smart/ContentPreview.tsx` - Main translation updates
- No translation files were modified (all keys already existed)

## Impact
- French users now see properly translated content outlines
- Content preview maintains professional appearance in all languages
- No performance impact on content generation
- Improved user experience for multilingual content creation
