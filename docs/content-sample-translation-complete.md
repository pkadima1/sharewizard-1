# Content Sample Translation Completion

## Summary
Successfully completed the final translation task by fixing the hardcoded English text in the content sample preview. The introductory content sample paragraph that was appearing in English even when the interface was set to French has been fully translated and made language-aware.

## Changes Made

### 1. ContentPreview.tsx - Tone Sample Translation
**File**: `src/components/wizard/smart/ContentPreview.tsx`

- **Replaced hardcoded English tone samples** with translation-key-based system
- **Updated `toneSample` useMemo** to use `t('step4.tone.examples.{toneKey}')` instead of hardcoded strings
- **Added language detection** to customize tone samples contextually while maintaining translated tone
- **Created tone key mapping** to handle all tone variations including new ones (informative, inspirational, humorous, empathetic)
- **Added smart fallbacks** for missing translations with professional tone default

### 2. Translation Keys Added
**Files**: 
- `public/locales/en/longform.json`
- `public/locales/fr/longform.json`

- **Added `defaultTopic` key** in preview section:
  - EN: `"defaultTopic": "your topic"`
  - FR: `"defaultTopic": "votre sujet"`

### 3. Dependency Fix
- **Fixed React Hook dependency warning** by adding `t` to the contentOutline useMemo dependencies
- **Ensured proper re-rendering** when language changes

## Technical Implementation

### Before (Hardcoded English):
```javascript
const toneExamples: Record<string, string> = {
  professional: `In today's competitive ${industry || 'business'} landscape, understanding ${keywordText} has become essential...`,
  // ... other hardcoded English examples
};
```

### After (Translation-Aware):
```javascript
const toneKeyMap: Record<string, string> = {
  professional: 'professional',
  casual: 'casual',
  // ... mapping to translation keys
};

const baseExample = t(`step4.tone.examples.${toneKey}`, '');
// Smart customization while preserving translated tone
return baseExample
  .replace(/ce sujet|this topic/gi, keywordText)
  .replace(/votre entreprise|your business/gi, industryText)
  .replace(/professionnels|professionals/gi, audienceText);
```

## Result
- ✅ **100% French UI** when language is set to French
- ✅ **All tone samples properly translated** using existing translation keys
- ✅ **Context-aware customization** maintains user's industry/audience while respecting language
- ✅ **Smart fallbacks** prevent broken UI if translations are missing
- ✅ **Build passes** without errors or warnings
- ✅ **Lint issues resolved** for the modified code

## Testing
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No new lint warnings introduced
- ✅ All tone examples now use proper translation system
- ✅ Language detection works correctly for French/English UI

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/wizard/smart/ContentPreview.tsx` - Main tone sample logic
2. `public/locales/en/longform.json` - Added defaultTopic key
3. `public/locales/fr/longform.json` - Added defaultTopic key

## Translation Status: COMPLETE
This completes the final piece of the translation integration. All new content structure formats and tone options are now:
- ✅ Fully integrated across UI, backend, and translations
- ✅ Translation-ready with proper i18n keys
- ✅ Production-ready with successful builds
- ✅ 100% French when interface is set to French
- ✅ All content sample preview text properly translated

The content generation wizard is now completely translation-ready and production-ready.
