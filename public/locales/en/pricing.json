      "trial": {
        "question": "What's included in the free trial?",
        "answer": "Basic plans include a 5-day free trial with 5 free requests. You can test all features available in your chosen plan during this period. Your subscription will begin after the trial period unless you cancel. Premium plans start immediately without a trial period."
      },
      "credits": {
        "question": "How does the credit system work?",
        "answer": "Our credit system is simple: 1 caption generation = 1 credit, 1 blog generation = 4 credits. This reflects the complexity difference between generating a social media caption vs. a full SEO-optimized blog post with our advanced AI system. Credits are used from your monthly allowance and reset each billing cycle."
      },
      "discountCode": {
        "question": "What does PERFECTSTART discount code offer?",
        "answer": "Use the discount code PERFECTSTART to get 50% off your first month on the Basic monthly plan only. This offer is not available for yearly plans or Premium plans. Enter the code at checkout to receive the discount on your first monthly billing cycle."
      },
      "terminology": {
        "question": "What do SEO, EEAT, and GEO mean?",
        "answer": "<strong>SEO</strong> (Search Engine Optimization) - Techniques to improve your content's visibility in search results. <strong>EEAT</strong> (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) - Google's quality guidelines for content evaluation. <strong>GEO</strong> (Generative Engine Optimization) - Tailoring content that sounds, connects, and feels human-like crafted."
      },
      "tracking": {
        "question": "How do I track my credit usage?",
        "answer": "You can track your credit usage in your account dashboard. Each time you generate content, the appropriate credits are deducted (1 for captions, 4 for blogs). Your remaining credits for the current billing cycle are always visible, and you'll receive notifications when you're running low."
      },
      "planDifference": {
        "question": "What's the difference between Basic and Premium plans?",
        "answer": "Basic plans are perfect for casual users and side hustlers with limited blog generation (17 blogs/year) and include a 5-day free trial. Premium plans are designed for content creators, marketers, and agencies who need high-volume content creation with advanced features like EEAT optimization, priority support, and no trial period for immediate access."
      },
      "changePlans": {
        "question": "Can I change plans later?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Changes will be reflected in your next billing cycle. Unused credits from your current plan will carry over when upgrading."
      },
      "refunds": {
        "question": "Do you offer refunds?",
        "answer": "We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied with your subscription. Contact our support team to process your refund."
