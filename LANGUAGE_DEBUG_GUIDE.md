# Language Detection Issue - Debug Guide

## Problem
Some users are experiencing an issue where the application displays text in French even though English is selected. This happens due to conflicts in the language detection system.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Conflicting language detection logic** - The i18n configuration had `caches: []` which disabled automatic localStorage caching
2. **Manual localStorage handling** - The LanguageContext was manually handling localStorage while i18n was also trying to manage it
3. **Browser language detection** - If the user's browser is set to French, it was being detected as the preferred language

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated i18n Configuration (`src/i18n.ts`)
- Enabled localStorage caching: `caches: ['localStorage']`
- Changed detection order to prioritize localStorage over browser detection
- Added explicit localStorage key configuration

### 2. Simplified LanguageContext (`src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx`)
- Removed manual localStorage handling
- Let i18n handle language detection automatically
- Simplified the detection logic

### 3. Updated Language Utilities (`src/utils/languageUtils.ts`)
- Removed manual localStorage handling
- Added `forceResetToEnglish()` function for emergency language reset
- Added `debugLanguageDetection()` function for troubleshooting

### 4. Enhanced Language Switcher (`src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`)
- Added "Reset to English" option in the language dropdown
- Provides easy way for users to force reset their language preference

## How to Fix Language Issues

### For Users:
1. **Use the Language Switcher**: Click the language dropdown in the navbar and select "Reset to English"
2. **Clear Browser Data**: Clear localStorage for the site (in browser dev tools → Application → Storage → Clear site data)
3. **Use Browser Console**: Open browser console and run:
   ```javascript
   // Force reset to English
   window.forceResetToEnglish();
   
   // Debug current language settings
   window.debugLanguageDetection();
   ```

### For Developers:
1. **Check localStorage**: Look for `i18nextLng` key in browser dev tools
2. **Check browser language**: Verify `navigator.language` in console
3. **Use debug utilities**: Call `window.debugLanguageDetection()` to see all language settings

## Debug Utilities Available

The following functions are available in the browser console:

```javascript
// Debug current language settings
window.debugLanguageDetection();

// Force reset to English
window.forceResetToEnglish();

// Re-detect language
window.detectAndSetLanguage();
```

## Prevention
- The updated configuration now properly handles language persistence
- localStorage is used consistently by i18n
- Browser language detection is used as fallback only
- Users can easily reset their language preference if needed

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Refresh the page
3. Verify that English is detected as the default language
4. Test language switching functionality
5. Verify that language preference persists across page reloads
